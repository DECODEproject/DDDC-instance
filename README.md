# Digital Democracy and Data Commons for Barcelona

This is the open-source repository for DDDC, based on [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim),
implementing the [DECODE](https://decodeproject.eu/) prototypes.


## Setting up the application

### Development

You will need to do some steps before having the app working properly once you've deployed it:

1. Clone this repository, go to the directory and starts with docker-compose
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alabs/DDDC
cd DDDC
docker-compose up
docker-compose run app rails db:create
docker-compose run app rails db:migrate
docker-compose run app rails db:seed
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/

### Staging

```bash
docker-compose run app bundle exec cap staging deploy
```

### Production

Push master branch to Heroku.

## About petitions module

We implemented the DECODE prototypes based on a Decidim module. It's on the `decidim-petitions/` directory.

### Configuring

Dependencies:

* [dddc-credential-issuer](https://github.com/DECODEproject/dddc-credential-issuer). Configures at config/secrets.yml (`decode.credential_issuer`).
* [dddc-petitions](https://github.com/DECODEproject/dddc-petition-api). Configures at config/secrets.yml (`decode.credential_issuer`).
* [bcnnow](https://github.com/DECODEproject/bcnnow). Configures at config/secrets.yml (`decode.credential_issuer`).
* [zenroom](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom). Binary self contained on `decidim-petitions/bin/zenroom-static`. If you want to upgrade it, you can follow these instructions (changing 0.8.1 for the new version as published on [Zenroom](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom). You can download the binary from Dyne.org (https://sdk.dyne.org:4443/view/decode/):

```bash
wget https://sdk.dyne.org:4443/view/decode/job/zenroom-static-amd64/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/src/zenroom-static -O decidim-petitions/bin/zenroom-static

### JSON Schema and Attributes Authorization

It's important to configure some JSON data so it's consumed by the DECODE's APIs:

**json_schema**

```json
{
  "mandatory": [
    {
      "predicate": "schema:addressLocality",
      "object": "Barcelona",
      "scope": "can-access",
      "provenance": {
        "url": "http://example.com"
      }
    }
  ],
  "optional": [
    {
      "predicate": "schema:dateOfBirth",
      "object": "voter",
      "scope": "can-access"
    },
    {
      "predicate": "schema:gender",
      "object": "voter",
      "scope": "can-access"
    }
  ]
}
```

**json_attribute_info**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "codes",
    "type": "str",
    "value_set": [ "eih5O","nuu3S","Pha6x","lahT4","Ri3ex","Op2ii","EG5th","ca5Ca","TuSh1","ut0iY","Eing8","Iep1H","yei2A","ahf3I","Oaf8f","nai1H","aib5V","ohH5v","eim2E","Nah5l","ooh5C","Uqu3u","Or2ei","aF9fa","ooc8W" ]
  }
]
```

**json_attribute_info_optional**

```json
[
  {
    "k": 2,
    "name": "age",
    "type": "str",
    "value_set": [ "0-19", "20-29", "30-39", ">40" ]
  },
  {
    "k": 2,
    "name": "gender",
    "type": "str",
    "value_set": [ "F", "M", "O" ]
  },
  {
    "k": 2,
    "name": "district",
    "type": "str",
    "value_set": [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10" ]
  }
]
```

## GraphQL

To consume some data, you can do it on the GraphQL API:

```graphql
{
petition(id:"1") {
id,
title,
description,
author,
json_schema,
image,
credential_issuer_api_url,
petitions_api_url,
attribute_id
}
}
```

An example with curl:

```bash
curl 'https://betadddc.alabs.org/api' -H 'content-type: application/json'  --data '{"query":"{ petition(id:\"1\") { id, title, description, author, json_schema, image, credential_issuer_api_url, petitions_api_url, attribute_id } }"}'
```
