Scenario 'coconut': "Sign petition: the Citizen signs the petition, with his own keys, aggregating it with the credential and with the Credential Issuer public key"
Given that I am known as 'identifier' 
and I have my keypair
and I have a signed credential
and I use the verification key by 'issuer_identifier'
When I aggregate all the verification keys
and I sign the petition 'petition'
Then print all data
