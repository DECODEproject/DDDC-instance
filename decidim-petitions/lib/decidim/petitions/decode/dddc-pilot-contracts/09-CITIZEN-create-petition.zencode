Scenario 'coconut': "Citizen creates a new petition, using his own key, the credential and the credential issuer's public"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
and I have my keypair
and I have a signed credential
and I use the verification key by 'issuer_identifier'
When I aggregate all the verification keys
and I generate a credential proof
and I create a new petition 'petition'
Then print all data
